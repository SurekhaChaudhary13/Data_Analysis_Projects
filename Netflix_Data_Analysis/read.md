# Netflix Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing a dataset containing information about TV shows and movies available on Netflix. The analysis is performed using Python programming language with the help of pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `Netflix_Data.csv`. It contains the following columns:

- **Title**: The title of the TV show or movie.
- **Category**: Whether the entry is a TV show or a movie.
- **Type**: The type of the content, such as dramas, comedies, etc.
- **Country**: The country where the content was produced.
- **Rating**: The rating of the content.
- **Duration**: The duration of the content.
- **Release_Date**: The release date of the content on Netflix.

## Tasks Performed

The following tasks are performed in the analysis:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and removing duplicates.
2. Exploratory data analysis, including:
   - Counting the number of TV shows and movies.
   - Finding the top countries with the highest number of TV shows and movies.
   - Identifying the year with the highest number of TV shows and movies released.
   - Visualizing the distribution of the release years.
   - Showing the distribution of content categories using bar graphs.
   - Filtering data based on specific criteria, such as release year and category.
   - Calculating the maximum duration of a movie or show.
   - Calculating the average duration of movies.
   - Filtering data for long-duration movies.
   - Grouping data by country and counting the number of entries for each country.
   - Filtering data for TV shows with more than 5 seasons.
   - Visualizing the distribution of numerical columns using histograms.
   - Exploring categorical columns using count plots.
   - Exploring relationships between categorical and numerical columns using box plots.
   - Identifying outliers using box plots.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`.
3. Clone this repository or download the `Netflix_Data.csv` file.
